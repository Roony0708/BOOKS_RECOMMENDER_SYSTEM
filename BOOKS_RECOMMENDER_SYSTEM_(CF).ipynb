        "1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Visualization: In this stage, the data related to books and user preferences will be analyzed and visualized. This includes understanding the distribution of various book genres, user ratings, and other relevant factors. The insights gained from this analysis will help in understanding the underlying patterns and trends in the data, which will be crucial for the next stage.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Model Development using Collaborative Filtering Algorithm: The core of the recommender system is the Collaborative Filtering algorithm. This algorithm predicts a userâ€™s interest by collecting preferences from many users. The assumption is that if two users agree on one issue, they are likely to agree on others as well. In the context of this project, if two users have similar book preferences, the system can recommend books liked by one user to the other."
